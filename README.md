## §QR QUICK REFERENCE — Load This First

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Target Commodity** | Soybean Oil (대두유) — crude and refined |
| **Import Origins** | USA · Argentina · Brazil · Vietnam |
| **Contract Basis** | CFR (Cost and Freight) — importer bears risk from origin port |
| **Typical Lead Time** | ~3 months (order → shipment → arrival) |
| **Decision Output** | Daily **Buy / Hold** procurement signal |
| **Signal Basis** | Bear (하락장) / Bull (상승장) regime + price band forecast |
| **Current Scope** | Soybean oil only — do NOT extend to other raw materials without explicit instruction |
| **Human Gate** | AI recommends; procurement team approves. No autonomous execution. |

### Goal Labels (used throughout all project files)
| ID | Goal | Primary Output |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Identify and rank price-driving variables | Feature importance rankings + automated risk alerts |
| **G2** | Forecast futures price volatility band in real time | 1·5·20·60일 확률 가격밴드 (P10/P50/P90 + 상승확률) |
| **G3** | Generate scenario-based Bear/Bull/Hold signals | Regime label + P&L impact estimate per scenario |

## §1 Problem Statement

An F&B manufacturer importing soybean oil faces three structural procurement failures:

| Failure | Current State | Target State |
|---|---|---|
| **Volatility management** | Reactive — follows lagging news and free indices | Proactive — real-time structural break detection |
| **Decision basis** | Buyer intuition + subjective judgment | Quantitative models + objective data signals |
| **Lead-time risk** | Discovered post-facto | Anticipated 3 months ahead via predictive pipeline |

**Why the US and Argentina dominate**: Together they produce ~80% of global soybeans. Local policy shifts and crop conditions in these two origins directly set CFR import prices. Vietnam is included as a secondary origin for refined oil.

**Current trigger**: US–Iran conflict (Hormuz Strait) causing persistent disruption to global logistics — a real-time test case for this system.

## §2 Analytical Goals

> Goal IDs G1/G2/G3 are used as shorthand throughout CLAUDE.md, Skills.md, and all code modules. Always resolve ambiguous references against §QR.

### G1 — Variable Importance & Risk Alerts
Identify which macro/micro factors most influence soybean oil prices and build automated alert triggers when those factors breach thresholds.

### G2 — Price Band Forecasting `[M]`
1·5·20·60 거래일 지평의 **확률 가격밴드**를 산출한다. 출력은 점추정이 아니라
P10/P25/P50/P75/P90 · 50/80/95% 구간 · 상승확률 · 임계가격 초과확률이며,
구간의 실측 coverage를 레짐별로 함께 보고한다.

### G3 — Bear/Bull/Hold Regime Signal `[M]`
시장을 Bear/Neutral/Bull로 분류하되 **하드 라벨이 아닌 레짐 확률**로 출력하고,
G2 예측분포와 결합해 Buy/Hold를 제안한다.
> **D-021 경계**: 내부 구매량·재고·마진이 없으므로 실제 회사 P&L 최적화를 주장하지 않는다.
> 공개 시장가 기준 **market-cost proxy와 regret**로 대체한다.

## §3 Data Requirements `[M]`

> The variable lists below are the current best-estimate pool. Additions and removals are expected as the project progresses. Treat them as a starting set, not a fixed schema.

### 3.2 Internal Data — ⛔ EXCLUDED (MEMORY D-021)

> **결정 D-021 (2026-07)**: 내부 S&OP/ERP 데이터는 **가용량 부족 + 더미 비중 과다**로
> **분석에 일절 사용하지 않는다**. 아래 표는 *참고용 도메인 목록*일 뿐이며, G1/G2/G3의 학습·검증·
> 피처 어디에도 투입되지 않는다. 모든 모델링은 **외부 파이프라인 데이터 전용**(구 "Phase B 내부검증"
> 설계는 폐기). 상세: `.claude/rules/modeling.md`.

| Domain | Key Data Points (참고용 — 미사용) |
|---|---|
| **S&OP** | Soybean oil input per SKU (kg/unit), Master Production Schedule (MPS), forecast vs. actual MAPE, seasonality coefficients, portfolio demand forecast (planned vs. executed) |
| **Procurement** | Order history (qty · contract unit price · order date · ETA), crude vs. refined import ratio and price delta, CFR freight change history, lead-time variance (contracted vs. actual), hedging P&L vs. market spot price at receipt, supplier offer price vs. market benchmark |
| **Supply / Logistics** | Monthly inventory levels (crude / refined), inventory turnover (monthly consumption basis), inbound lead-time actuals (order → shipment → arrival by stage) |

## §4 Analytical Methodology `[M]`

> All method selections are preliminary and subject to change. Do NOT treat a listed method as a committed implementation until it appears in the corresponding `src/` module.

### 4.1 Methods by Goal

> 2026-08-12 개정 — 근거: `docs/research_desk/2026-08/model_strategy_2026_08_12/`.
> 단일 모델을 미리 확정하지 않고 **Champion–Challenger**로 운영한다.

| Goal | Champion (현행) | Challenger (게이트 통과 후 비교) | 정성 계층 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Elastic Net + LightGBM/XGBoost + SHAP·Permutation + Granger·국소투영 | — | P1-05 ABSA 사건 신호(evidence 필수) |
| **G2** | SARIMAX + Quantile LightGBM + EGARCH-X → **EnCQR** 구간 보정 | GRU/LSTM · N-BEATSx/N-HiTS · TFT · PatchTST · Chronos | 사건 더미(중복 병합·vintage 보존) |
| **G3** | Markov Switching/HMM 레짐 확률 + G2 분포 결합 | — | 시나리오 분석 · HITL 게이트 |

**예측 지평**: 1 · 5 · 20 · 60 거래일 **직접 예측**(재귀는 보조 실험).
**Baseline 필수**: last value · seasonal naive · ETS — 이를 못 이기면 승격 없음.

### 4.3 시점 정합성(as-of) — 모든 모델 공통 하드 제약

```text
모델의 t일 입력값 = available_at ≤ t 를 만족하는 가장 최근 값
```

모든 피처에 `event_time` · `release_time` · `available_at` · `source_vintage`를 둔다.
WASDE·PSD 등 월·연간 자료는 **기간 말이 아니라 실제 발표일 이후에만** 모델이 볼 수 있다.
개정치는 덮어쓰지 않고 vintage별로 적재한다. 상세: `.claude/rules/modeling.md`.

## §5 Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative / Financial
| Outcome | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Raw material cost reduction | Data-driven buy timing replaces intuition-based purchasing |
| KPI achievement | Proactive buy success rate + target cost reduction rate (targets TBD with stakeholders) |
| Safety stock cost reduction | Forecast-linked hybrid inventory model prevents excess stockpiling |
| Cash flow risk reduction | Scenario-based positioning buffers against price extremes |

### Operational
| Outcome | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Reactive → Proactive paradigm | Structural break detection replaces lagging news-following |
| Decision transparency | Shared quantitative signals align S&OP, Procurement, Finance |
| Lead-time preparedness | 3-month horizon risk anticipation including Hormuz / logistics shock scenarios |

### Integration Targets
- **Dashboard**: Daily Buy/Hold signal + key price drivers → leverage in spot contract negotiations
- **ERP/S&OP linkage**: External shock detection → real-time simulation of impact on MPS and material requirements → enterprise-wide control tower function
