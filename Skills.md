## Why a Separate Folder per Phase?

Loading all agent definitions into a single context is a primary cause of **context rot** — the degradation of model reasoning as irrelevant rules compete for attention tokens. The folder structure below ensures:

- A Phase 1 data-ingestion session loads only Phase 1 + Common agent skills
- A Phase 3 procurement optimization session loads only Phase 3 + Common + relevant Phase 2 outputs
- Phase 3 agents explicitly reference which Phase 2 agents they extend (see INDEX.md inheritance map)

## Google NotebookLM Integration Strategy

NotebookLM serves as the project's **persistent knowledge base layer** — a citable, searchable repository that agents draw from before generating outputs. This decouples long-term domain knowledge (market reports, policy documents, historical analyses) from the active agent context window.

### Why NotebookLM (not just Perplexity or RAG)?
| Capability | NotebookLM Advantage |
|---|---|
| Source citation | Every answer cites the exact uploaded document and page — critical for procurement audit trails |
| Audio summaries | Dense WASDE or EPA regulatory reports can be consumed as audio briefings |
| Persistent knowledge | Uploaded documents persist across sessions; Perplexity searches are ephemeral |
| Private documents | 외부 공개 보고서(WASDE·GAIN·EPA 등) 업로드용. ⛔ **내부 S&OP/조달 데이터는 분석 미사용**(MEMORY D-021) — 업로드·투입 금지 |

### Integration Workflow (Current — No Public API)
```
Step 1: Human uploads documents to named NotebookLM notebooks (see INDEX.md registry)
Step 2: Agent skill file specifies which notebook to query and what question to ask
Step 3: Human queries NotebookLM → pastes cited summary into agent context
Step 4: Agent processes NotebookLM output + current data → generates structured output
Step 5: C-07 Documentation Agent packages session outputs for NLM-06 archive upload
```

### When NotebookLM API Becomes Available
Replace Step 2–3 with a direct tool call in the agent's process block:
```python
# Future: direct NotebookLM API integration
notebooklm_response = call_notebooklm_api(
    notebook="NLM-01: Soybean Oil Market Intelligence",
    query=f"Latest supply/demand developments affecting soybean oil price, {current_date}"
)
```

### Named Notebooks (Maintained by C-02 + C-07)
| Notebook | Content | Primary Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `NLM-01: Soybean Oil Market Intelligence` | Price reports, analyst research, CBOT data summaries | C-02, P1-01, P2-02 |
| `NLM-02: Geopolitical Risk Monitor` | News corpora, think tank briefs, conflict indices | P1-02, P2-01 |
| `NLM-03: Climate & Crop Outlook` | ENSO bulletins, WASDE reports, weather anomaly data | P1-03 |
| `NLM-04: Regulatory Environment` | EPA RFS, Korea RFS, tariff schedules, trade policy | C-02, P1-01 |
| `NLM-05: Supplier Intelligence` | Supplier profiles, offer price history, CFR benchmarks | P1-04, P3-03 |
| `NLM-06: Project Documentation Archive` | All reports, MEMORY.md snapshots, session summaries | C-01, C-07 |

## LLM & Claude Model Selection by Agent

### Rationale Framework
| Model | Use When | Avoid When |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | High-stakes strategic reasoning, multi-variable synthesis, final G3 procurement signals | Routine code generation — cost-inefficient |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6** | Code generation, standard analysis, report writing, pipeline design | Need real-time web data |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5** | Pattern matching, style checks, formatting, deterministic rule-following | Complex multi-step reasoning |
| **Perplexity Pro** | Real-time commodity prices, news, regulatory updates, web-sourced intelligence | Long-document synthesis |
| **Gemini AI Pro** | Documents > 50 pages, multi-modal (chart + data), 2M-token context tasks | Code generation |
| **ChatGPT Team** | Structured table extraction, quick arithmetic validation | Complex reasoning or code |
